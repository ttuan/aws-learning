# AWS CloudSearch
Amazon CloudSearch is a fully managed search service in the cloud that brings to the search space many of the benefits that AWS brings in the hardware, storage and database spaces.

## Search Domain
Your search domain will hold the collection of data you want to make searchable.

## Search Engine
The search engine matches the entered text against the content it has, scores and ranks the results, and returns them to you. Search engines use ranking functions to mix statistical information on the text match with a priori information to evaluate the possibilities, and sorting to retrieve the best ones.

### Document
At the heart of search is the search document. Documents are objects that are loaded into the search engine on one end from an external source or sources and sent out from the search engine at the other end as a response to a search query. They are composite objects, gathering different kinds of information, possibly from different sources, that describe the underlying object. The information in the document is structured into fields and values.
