# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources for you, making it easy to build applications that respond quickly to new information.

After create lambda function, you can create test script to trigger. View log

We can use AWS Lambda in two ways:
* As an event-driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events, such as uploading image files as youâ€™ll see in this lab.
* As a compute service to run your code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway or API calls.
