# AWS CodeCommit

AWS CodeCommit is a highly scalable, managed source control service that hosts private Git repositories. CodeCommit stores your data in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB giving your repositories high scalability, availability, and durability. You simply create a repository to store your code. There is no hardware to provision and scale or software to install, configure, and operate.
