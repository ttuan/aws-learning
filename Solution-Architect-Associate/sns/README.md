# Amazon SNS

Amazon SNS is a notification service that provides significant advantages over the complexity of developing custom messaging solutions or the expense of licensed software for systems that need to be managed and maintained on site.
To prevent messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are stored redundantly across multiple servers and data centers

 To run the whole process asynchronously, you will use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to decouple the process of receiving information about new posts and starting their audio conversion.
