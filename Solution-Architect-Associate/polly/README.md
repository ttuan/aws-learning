# Amazon Polly

Amazon Polly is an Amazon AI service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice.
In other use cases, such as real-time streaming, size isn't a problem because Amazon Polly starts to stream speech back as soon as the first bytes are available.
