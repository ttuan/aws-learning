# Amazon Cognito

Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. Your users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, or Google. The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services. You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.

Cognito enables you to use your own identity provider (Sign in with Facebook, Login with Amazon, Cognito User Pools, etc.) to generate temporary key pairs (Access Key ID and Secret Key)
