# Amazon Machine Images
Amazon EC2 provides templates known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that contain a software configuration (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications). You use these templates to launch an instance, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual server in the cloud.

A Quick Start AMI is independent of the instance type.

An AMI is really just a template document that contains information telling EC2 what OS and application software to include on the root data volume of the instance itâ€™s about to launch. There are four kinds of AMIs.

* Amazon Quick Start AMI
* AWS Marketplace AMI: official, production-ready images provided and supported by industry vendors like SAP and Cisco.
* Community AMIs (more than 100k images) created and maintained by independent vendors and are usually built to meet a specific need.
* Private AMI

A particular AMI will be available in only a single region. Keep this in mind as you plan your deployments: invoking the ID of an AMI in one region while working from within a differ- ent region will fail.
