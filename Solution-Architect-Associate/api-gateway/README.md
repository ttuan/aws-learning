# API Gateway
API Gateway is a managed service provided by AWS that makes creating, deploying and maintaining APIs easy.

Transform the body and headers of incoming API requests to match backend systems
Transform the body and headers of the outgoing API responses to match API requirements
Control API access via AWS Identity and Access Management
Create and apply API keys for third-party development
Enable Amazon CloudWatch integration for API monitoring
Cache API responses via Amazon CloudFront for faster response times
Deploy an API to multiple stages, allowing easy differentiation between development, test, production as well as versioning
Connect custom domains to an API
Define models to help standardize your API request and response transformations
