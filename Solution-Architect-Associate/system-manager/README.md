# AWS System Manager

Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities for configuring and managing your Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises servers and virtual machines (VMs), and certain other AWS resources. The service includes a unified interface that lets you easily centralize operational data and automate tasks across your AWS resources. Systems Manager shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems in your infrastructure. The service gives you a complete view of your infrastructure performance and configuration, simplifies resource and application management, and makes it easy to operate and manage your infrastructure at scale.

We can run a command (install cloudwatch agent, or do smt with multiple instances - both linux and window instance)
