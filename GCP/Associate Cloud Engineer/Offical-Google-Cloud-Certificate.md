# Official Google Cloud Certificate Book

## Chapter 1. Overview of GCP
### Types of Cloud Services
#### 1. Compute Resources
1. Virtual Machines

	Google Cloud Platform offers a variety of preconfigured VMs with varying numbers of vCPUs and amounts of memory. You can also create a custom configuration if the preconfigured offerings do not meet your needs. A VM that you manage is like having a server in your office that you have full administrator rights to.

2. Managed Kubernetes Clusters

	Tools you need to create and manage clusters of servers. Allow users focus on their applications and not the tasks needed to keep a cluster of servers up and running.
Managed clusters make use of containers. The services are deployed through containers, and the cluster management service takes care of monitoring, networking, and some security management tasks.

3. Serverless Computing

	An approach that allows developers and application administrators to run their code in a computing environment that does not require setting up VMs or kubernetes clusters: **App Engine** (extended periods of time - website backend, point of sale system, custom business app) and **Cloud Functions** (code response to an event - upload a file, add a message to queue, ..)


#### 2. Storage
1. Object storage
	- A system that manages the use of storage in terms of objects or blobs. **Usually these objects are files, but it is important to note that the files are not stored in a conventional file system**. Objects are grouped into buckets. Each object is individually addressable, usually by a URL.
   - Serverless. There is no need to create VMs and attach storage to them.
   - Access controls can be applied at the object level.

2. File storage
	- A hierarchical storage system for files. Provides network shared file systems. **Cloud Firestore**: based on Network File System.
	- Suitable for application that require operating system-like file access to files.

3. Block storage
	- Uses a fixed-size data structure called a block to organize data. Block storage is commonly used in **ephemeral and persistent disks attached to VMs**.
	- A persistent disk: Store data even it detached form VM. Ephemeral disks exist and store data only as long as a VM is running.

4. Caches
	- In-memory data stores that maintain fast access to data.
	- Expensive, can lose data when power is lost, OS rebooted; can get out of sync with the system data.


#### 3. Networking
Need to control IP addresses, internal & external IP, firewall rules, peering VPC

#### 4.  Specialized Services
+ Serverless; you do not need to configure servers or clusters.
+ Provide a specific function, such as translating text or analyzing images.
+ AutoML, Cloud Natural Language, Cloud Vision, Cloud Inference API

### Cloud Computing vs Data Center Computing
#### 1. Rent Instead of Own Resources
- Spend a significant amount of money up front to purchase equipment or commit to a long-term lease for the equipment
- Hard to autoscale

#### 2. Pay-as-You-Go-for-What-You-Use Model
#### 3. Elastic Resource Allocation
